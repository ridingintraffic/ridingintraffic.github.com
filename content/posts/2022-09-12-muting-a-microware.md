# Microware muting
Ok fine usually I will talk about tech things and IT things, but this is a quality of life thing.
It turns out that you can mute your microwave.  While i never thought that this would be a thing, it does make really good sense and yea, that should be a thing.    30 seconds later I googled "mute <brand> microwave"   and low and behold.
```
whirlpool microwave:
keypad mute:
press and hold 1 for 3 seconds hear "beep beep"
end of cycle mute:
pread and hold 2 for 3 seconds hear "beep beep"
```
