I have been thinking that I should start writing again.  Over the past few years I have gone back and forth on the writing and finding both the time and the inspiration to begin writing again.
Why have I not been writing enough?
Part of it is I have not had the creative energy, and I have not had the inspiration, or I have not been remembering to do it.
Also, I've not been writing down things I'm learning, and it's frustrating because I cannot remember what things are, and in order to solve that, I simply need to write things down and start writing again.
So, I am going to try to do some transcription to blog entries, and it will be a bit rambling because I am speaking rather than typing, but I think I can save some time, and maybe get the things out of my head when I have that creative energy. Then just do some editing afterwards. From there I hopefully will start to create more written content for people to read and digest. Possibly I can then bolt on the recordings of my train of thought as well. I don't know, maybe that can be useful. I can also do a voiceover reading of the article that I write, because I guess I have a pretty decent reading voice. This is just something that I have been thinking about, and I think it might work, because I have spent a couple months now doing audio journaling. This audio journaling lets me gather my thoughts and get things out of my head verbally.  Which has allowed me to become more fluent in getting those thoughts out, clearly.
So we're gonna give it a try.

... update   its been a month and i havent gotten any better about writing again.
It would seem that life is really difficult some/most days.
