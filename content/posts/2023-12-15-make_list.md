Working with make commands can be tiresome. 
Especially when those makefiles are really long and you do not know what commands are in them or you cannot remember what the commands are named.  
Here is a neat little trick to help with that.  
`make list`

```
<Makefile>
test:
	echo "testing"

build:
	echo "building"

deploy:
	echo "deploying"

list:
	@grep '^[^#[:space:]].*:' Makefile | sort
```
just add the extra list command to a makefile like this 
```
list:
	@grep '^[^#[:space:]].*:' Makefile | sort
```

and then when you run it you get  
```
$ make list
test:
build:
deploy:
```
