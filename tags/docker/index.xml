      <description>docker powershell To prove a point i went out and foudn that there is a microsoft supported docker image for powershell. dockerhub - microsoft
this means that running a mac, you can run docker that runs linux and then will let you run powershell.. You must go deeper&amp;hellip; ha

      <description>docker reboot Every once and a while for prem docker installation a reboot is needed. There are some tools out there that can most likely do this, but today a quick and dirty bash script solved the problem.
Step one dump all the running container IDS, today there were about 23 containers running. docker ps -q &amp;gt;&amp;gt;ids
Next reboot sudo reboot Finally the bash script to quickly spin them all back up.</description>

      <description>Splunk and nginx Doing some splunkjs work from a docker container, and hosting it out of nginx, which means I needed to configure a proxy pass using some load balancing in order to access the splunk cluster, this was a little tricky because of session persistence and https. nginx load balancing Luckily there are some good pslunk blogs out there that help out configuring-nginx-with-splunk-rest-api-sdk-compatibility and some good reading about splunkjs read them both using-the-splunkjs-stack-part-1</description>

      <description>Productive Saturday rant Been cranking away at my laptop from 630-830 this morning, and realizing that my ancient mac book air battery which was already replace once, is just a poor shadow of what it should be. I&amp;rsquo;m only going to get about 3 hours out of this battery before it dies. Which is sad because i really wanted to get a new laptop this year but mac did not really give us any options.</description>
