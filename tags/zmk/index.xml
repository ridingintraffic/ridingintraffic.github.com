      <description>I am trying to create a dongle setup to use with my wireless skeltyls. I have not been using them as much as i would like because they are a giant pita to deal with when they come out of sleep, and when they are reconnecting. so i thought that i would like to try and do a dongle mode with them and see how it goes.
Working with ZMK dongles mode in ZMK I have a ZMK keyboard.</description>
