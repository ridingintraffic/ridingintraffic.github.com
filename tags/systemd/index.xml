      <description>Systemd restarting A while ago I had a service that would need to be restarted after it had a cool down of about 2 hours&amp;hellip; I had a stanza that stated
Restart=always RestartSec=7200 which was cool because it would just autorestart when it died. At the time the restart would work just fine after the cooldown. The catch that I ran in to was because of that timer, if I logged in and tried to start it when it was in a failed state, the service would hang.</description>

      <description>Systemd restart policy sometimes services die. sometimes there is not a better option because of the situatuion that you are in, and you just need to wait it out and then restart the service&amp;hellip; I know it isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal and that there should be better ways around having to do this but hey ¯_(ツ)_/¯
[Service] Type=simple Restart=always RestartSec=3 ExecStart=/path/to/script In my case I needed to wait it out and restart the service 2 hours after it died.</description>
