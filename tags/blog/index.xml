      <description>keyboard mounts this is the easiest cleanest and cheapest way I have found to mount a split keyboard.
the sticker that you apply to the keyboard case has adhesive and can be bought in a multi pack
these are great because they are pretty cheap and their height is less that your standard silicon bumpon, therefore you can have the bumpons for feet and they will sit nicely on any flat surface when not mounted</description>

      <description>It turns out that if you were using terraform.io as a remote state only situation, hashicorp is upping the price to a price per resource model and making things really expensive. It is now time to migrate from tf.io to s3 and not pay a ton of money..
BLADE And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap... RAZOR ...IF it weren&amp;#39;t run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!</description>

      <description>adeventures in old technology so there is an application called minimodem and it will transmit and receive data at various bps etc. why not see what it takes to move a 1.5mb file. cause lol
base64 -i img.jpg|minimodem --tx 9600 --ascii -f 9600.wav ffmpeg -i 9600.wav 9600.mp3 ffmpeg -i 9600.mp3 9600.wav minimodem --rx 9600 -f 9600.wav|base64 -d &amp;gt;img_output9600.png at 9600 bps the file is 36 minutes long. and 120mb once in mp3 its 17mb.</description>

      <description>terraform targeting https://github.com/ridingintraffic/ridingintraffic.github.com/wiki/code_sre#terraform-targetingd Yes you are supposed to never use a targeted plan and apply in terraform becuase it is the violation of the Infra as code creed. But you know what sometimes you just gotta do a thing and get it done. Then you never want to remember your shame and as a result you go and forget how to do that thing. so here it is
terraform plan -target=&amp;#34;aws_appautoscaling_scheduled_action.</description>

      <title>gitlab exit codes aws arm building</title>

      <description>gitlab and exit codes Sometimes gitlab will have a command or a script that runs and it will not trap an exit code properly.
This results in an error condition happening in a script, but the job in the pipeline to come back green.
here is some meat and context around the issue as well. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/25394 and then a bit more here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77601 and then of course it still isn&amp;rsquo;t fixed as of today&amp;rsquo;s writing https://gitlab.</description>

      <title>boost audio on video file</title>
      <link>https://ridingintraffic.github.io/posts/2023-08-14-audio_boost/</link>

      <description>Was the audio too quiet on something that you recorded?
Are you lazy and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to drop in the file to a timeline editor just so you can gain boost?
most laptops will have ffmpeg on them, and if your mac doesnt then a simple brew install ffmpeg https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i &amp;#34;your_input_file.mp4&amp;#34; -vcodec copy -filter:a &amp;#34;volume=15dB&amp;#34; &amp;#34;your_output_file.mp4&amp;#34; there you have it short and simple now your video file is louder.</description>

      <description>I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar. this is an old post from 2018 that I never added here but I thought it was still relevant today - Roll with the punches, go with the flow, make it up as you go… People always say that you should stay flexible with your plans. Don’t be afraid to change things. Never in my wildest dreams would I fully understand what it means to live a life of constant improvisation than when we had our first child.</description>
