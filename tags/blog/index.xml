      <description>gitlab and exit codes Sometimes gitlab will have a command or a script that runs and it will not trap an exit code properly.
This results in an error condition happening in a script, but the job in the pipeline to come back green.
here is some meat and context around the issue as well. https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/25394 and then a bit more here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/77601 and then of course it still isn&amp;rsquo;t fixed as of today&amp;rsquo;s writing https://gitlab.</description>

      <title>boost audio on video file</title>

      <description>Was the audio too quiet on something that you recorded?
Are you lazy and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to drop in the file to a timeline editor just so you can gain boost?
most laptops will have ffmpeg on them, and if your mac doesnt then a simple brew install ffmpeg https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i &amp;#34;your_input_file.mp4&amp;#34; -vcodec copy -filter:a &amp;#34;volume=15dB&amp;#34; &amp;#34;your_output_file.mp4&amp;#34; there you have it short and simple now your video file is louder.</description>

      <description>I am a leaf on the wind, watch how I soar. this is an old post from 2018 that I never added here but I thought it was still relevant today - Roll with the punches, go with the flow, make it up as you go… People always say that you should stay flexible with your plans. Don’t be afraid to change things. Never in my wildest dreams would I fully understand what it means to live a life of constant improvisation than when we had our first child.</description>
