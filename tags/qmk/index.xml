      <description>player 2(040) has entered the game. During the past 2 years if you had not noticed, there has been a chip shortage. Namely the atmega 32u4 chips that power the elite-c and pro micros microcontrollers that are at the centers of custom keyboards. It just so happened that during this time raspberry pi developed a microcontroller of their own. This is known as the rp2040. rp2040 Why does this matter? Well we can now get the 2040 as a drop in replacement for the pro micros.</description>

      <description>Mechanical and custom keyboards What was “old” is new again, Mechanical keyboards! A mechanical keyboard is one that has a discrete mechanical switch under each and every key. There are a number of sites out there that can go into the specific details about exactly how these function, as well as all the differences between the switches. This article is not going into much detail about the switches themselves but rather everything else.</description>

      <description>QMK deepdive using a sweeet16 16 keys!? What can be done with 16 keys for a keyboard? Using an amazing open source firmware and a kit by 1upkeyboards, much can be done with only 16 keys. QMK is a powerhouse of a firmware that allows an endless combination of regular keys, functions and extended macros. These features are relatively easy to construct and the firmware itself can be very easy to build and flash.</description>
