      <description>Microware muting Ok fine usually I will talk about tech things and IT things, but this is a quality of life thing. It turns out that you can mute your microwave. While i never thought that this would be a thing, it does make really good sense and yea, that should be a thing. 30 seconds later I googled &amp;ldquo;mute microwave&amp;rdquo; and low and behold.
whirlpool microwave: keypad mute: press and hold 1 for 3 seconds hear &amp;#34;beep beep&amp;#34; end of cycle mute: pread and hold 2 for 3 seconds hear &amp;#34;beep beep&amp;#34; </description>
