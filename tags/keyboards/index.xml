      <description>Mechanical and custom keyboards What was “old” is new again, Mechanical keyboards! A mechanical keyboard is one that has a discrete mechanical switch under each and every key. There are a number of sites out there that can go into the specific details about exactly how these function, as well as all the differences between the switches. This article is not going into much detail about the switches themselves but rather everything else.</description>

      <description>QMK deepdive using a sweeet16 16 keys!? What can be done with 16 keys for a keyboard? Using an amazing open source firmware and a kit by 1upkeyboards, much can be done with only 16 keys. QMK is a powerhouse of a firmware that allows an endless combination of regular keys, functions and extended macros. These features are relatively easy to construct and the firmware itself can be very easy to build and flash.</description>

      <description>I am trying to create a dongle setup to use with my wireless skeltyls. I have not been using them as much as i would like because they are a giant pita to deal with when they come out of sleep, and when they are reconnecting. so i thought that i would like to try and do a dongle mode with them and see how it goes.
Working with ZMK dongles mode in ZMK I have a ZMK keyboard.</description>
